# Matching URL Regex



## Summary
Regular expressions (regex) play a vital role in parsing and validating text patterns within strings, and one common use case is matching URLs. A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. Matching URL regex involves crafting a regular expression pattern that can accurately identify and extract URLs from text data. This task is particularly useful in web development, data extraction, and content analysis, where parsing and processing URLs are essential for various operations such as data scraping, link analysis, and routing in web applications. In this tutorial, we will delve into the intricacies of constructing and understanding a regex pattern specifically tailored for matching URLs, breaking down each component of the expression to provide a comprehensive understanding of its functionality and usage.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors serve as markers indicating the beginning and end points for the regular expression search. The "^" symbol signifies a match at the start of a string, while the "$" symbol denotes a match at the end. When used together, they signify that the entire string must precisely match the pattern enclosed between them, creating a requirement for an exact string match. In the given expression, the combination of both "^" and "$" anchors ensures an exact match for the entire collection of meta characters, thereby constraining the search to exact matches only.

### Quantifiers
-Quantifiers dictate the number of occurrences of a character, group, or character class within the expression. This character combination encompasses various quantifiers, which are elaborated upon in the table of contents for further understanding of groups, capturing, and brackets.

-The * symbol matches anything preceding it zero to infinite times, depending on the occurrences in the string. Within the third capture group, "([/\w .-])*", it searches for instances of the specified criteria within the brackets and then allows for the repetition of those criteria, including the potential for zero occurrences.

-The "+" symbol matches one or more occurrences, excluding zero occurrences. In the capture group "([\da-z.-]+)", the "+" symbol matches any number of instances as declared within the square brackets, ensuring at least one occurrence.

-The "?" symbol matches zero or one occurrence. For instance, the first capture group "(https?://)?" accepts either zero or one instance of "s".

-The "{}" quantifier specifies the number of occurrences of the preceding group or character. Within the last capture group, "([a-z.]{2,6})", the "{2,6}" expression seeks 2 to 6 instances of the character based on the criteria defined within the square brackets.
